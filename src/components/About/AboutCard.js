            </p>
            <p className="bio">I am a former project manager turned full stack web developer. I recently earned a certificate from the<b className="purple">University of Washington Coding Program,</b> with newly developed skills in <b className="purple">Javascript, CSS, Node.js, Express, React.js and much more.</b>
              As a <b className="purple">project manager</b>, I am a leader with strengths in communication and cultivating relationships. I have a strong ability to work independently as well as a team. I am also a strategic thinker and self-motivated individual able to manage several projects and perform under pressure in fast-paced, deadline-focused environments.
              As a <b className="purple">web developer</b>, I am an innovative problem solver passionate about developing fun, user-friendly applications. Having skills in multiple facets of a business gives me a better understanding on how the business operates and help it grow. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a rapid, quality-driven team to build better experiences for all.
              Please feel free to check out my projects.</p>
